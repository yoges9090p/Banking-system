# Banking-system
#It's a very basic project, but i tried my best to make it useful in real life.
At first i made the same project without mysql. I saved the customer data to a text file in json format.But it was messy. So i learned how to use mysql and applied that knowledge in my project. 
I worked on small things and bugs and it was such a good experience.
